# drivewealth-back-office-javascript

JavaScript bindings for the DriveWealth Back Office API

[Usage](#usage)  
[API Reference](https://github.com/DriveWealth/drivewealth-back-office-javascript/blob/master/reference.md)  
[Examples](https://github.com/DriveWealth/drivewealth-back-office-javascript/tree/master/examples)

## Usage

#### Step 1: Install

Install using your favorite package manager (or [download from Github](https://github.com/DriveWealth/drivewealth-javascript/tree/master/lib)):

```bash
$ npm i --save drivewealth
$ bower install --save drivewealth
```

#### Step 2: Include

This library works in your Node-based server:

```javascript
// Node.js
const drivewealth = require("drivewealth-back-office");
```

…as well as in varying browser environments—though, keep in mind your API key is a ticket to viewing and modifying your clients' personal and financial data. Thus, if used in a browser application (or any environment where requests may be publicly examined or code is interpreted), such application should be Intranet-only, ad-hoc installed, or otherwise protected.

```javascript
// Browserify
const drivewealth = require("drivewealth-back-office");

// RequireJS
requirejs.config({
	paths: { drivewealth: "path/to/drivewealth-back-office" }
});
define(["drivewealth-back-office"], function(drivewealth) { ... })

// Browser
<script src="path/to/drivewealth-back-office.js"></script>
console.log(drivewealth);
```

This library also supports flow annotations, which you can use in an ES6-compatible project:

```
import drivewealth from "drivwealth-back-office/src";
```

#### Step 3: Setup

You'll need to call the setup function to initialize the library. In this call, pass a function that the library will use to make HTTP requests. The library supports a few [out of the box](https://github.com/DriveWealth/drivewealth-back-office-javascript/tree/master/lib/httpImpls).

```javascript
drivewealth.setup({
	env: drivewealth.ENVIRONMENTS.UAT,
	httpImpl: require("node_modules/drivewealth-back-office/lib/httpImpls/request.js")
});
```

#### Step 4: Use

```javascript
drivewealth.Auth.login("john.smith", "passw0rd").then(response => {
	console.info(`Welcome!`);
});
```
